Perfect! Let me create comprehensive instructions for Riplet to do the validation internally.

RIPLET VALIDATION INSTRUCTIONS
Mission:
Validate that every page implementation matches the Figma design 100% - ZERO interpretation, ZERO justification. Every pixel, color, spacing, font, component must be EXACTLY as shown in Figma.
Figma File Access:

File URL: https://www.figma.com/design/uiKYBRuxCeFxk7UuQswyMN/Marketplace
You have full access - use it to pull exact specs for each page

URLs to Validate:
/info/seller
/info/wholesaler
/info/agent
/our-leadership
/login
/onboarding
/user/profile
/user/verify-now
/user/contact
/user/contact/:id
/user/notifications
/user/inbox
/find-your-next-deal
/user/buy
/user/buy/preference
/user/property-details/:id
/user/my-bids
/user/bid-details/:id
/user/seller-counter
/user/counter-bid
/user/my-offers
/user/offer-details/:id
/sell
/sell/add
/affiliate
/property-details-admin
/upload-contacts
Your Tasks:
Step 1: Map Every URL to Figma
For each URL above:

Identify which Figma page/frame it corresponds to
If no Figma design exists for a URL → Flag it as "MISSING DESIGN"
If multiple URLs share the same design → Note it
Create a master mapping document

Step 2: Validate Each Page (100% Match)
For each page that has a Figma design:
Layout & Structure:

 Grid system matches exactly
 Section spacing matches (px-perfect)
 Component positioning matches exactly
 Responsive breakpoints match Figma specs

Typography:

 Font family matches exactly
 Font sizes match exactly
 Font weights match exactly
 Line heights match exactly
 Letter spacing matches exactly
 Text colors match exactly (hex codes)

Colors & Styling:

 Background colors match exactly
 Border colors match exactly
 Shadow values match exactly
 Gradient values match exactly (if any)
 Opacity values match exactly

Components:

 Buttons: size, padding, border-radius, colors, hover states
 Input fields: size, padding, border, focus states
 Cards: spacing, shadows, borders
 Navigation: layout, spacing, active states
 Icons: size, color, positioning
 Images: size, aspect ratio, positioning

Interactions:

 Hover states match Figma
 Active states match Figma
 Loading states match Figma
 Error states match Figma
 Disabled states match Figma

Spacing:

 Margins match exactly
 Padding matches exactly
 Gap between elements matches exactly

Step 3: Report Back in This Format:
markdown## PAGE: /user/buy
**Figma Frame:** [Page Name > Frame Name]
**Status:** ✅ MATCHES / ❌ DISCREPANCIES / ⚠️ MISSING DESIGN

### Discrepancies Found:
1. **Button padding:** Figma=16px 32px | Current=12px 24px
2. **Heading font size:** Figma=32px | Current=28px
3. **Card shadow:** Figma=0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) | Current=0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)

### Components Not Matching:
- Navigation active state color
- Search input border-radius

---

## PAGE: /user/profile
...
Critical Rules:

NO INTERPRETATION - If Figma shows 16px, it must be 16px. Not 15px, not 17px, not "close enough"
NO JUSTIFICATION - Don't explain why something is different. Just flag it.
USE DEV MODE - Pull exact specs from Figma's dev mode for pixel-perfect values
FLAG EVERYTHING - Even minor discrepancies matter
CHECK ALL STATES - Default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading, error
RESPONSIVE CHECKS - Validate mobile, tablet, desktop if Figma has those designs

Deliverable:
Create a complete audit report showing:

✅ Pages that match 100%
❌ Pages with discrepancies (with exact details)
⚠️ URLs missing Figma designs
📋 Master URL-to-Figma mapping
